### New Feature

*  **Unrecognized commands provide no feedback. [#146](https://github.com/twitter/cli-guide.js/issues/146)**

> Entering a command that doesn’t exactly match the expected input has no response. E.g. I left the path to the aurora config file off from the aurora job create … command, and there was error message from the client telling me what I did wrong.

For support this feature It was added a RegEx for validate <code>aurora job create</code>

       "regexp": "aurora\\sjob\\screate\\s[a-z-.-_--]+\/[a-z-.-_--]+\/[a-z-.-_--]+\/[a-z-.-_--]+\\s[a-zA-Z-.-_--]{0,}(\\.aurora)"


This feature was added in Apache Aurora Tutorial and here you are the example [JSON template](https://github.com/twitter/cli-guide.js/blob/master/templates/apache_aurora_commands_validations.json)


### Demo

* **add default values in terminal and step [#142](https://github.com/twitter/cli-guide.js/issues/142)**

> The Idea is to show a demo without JSON templates
